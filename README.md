# Fish Diversity and Water Quality in the Chicago Waterways

This repository contains code and analysis for studying the relationship between water quality indicators and fish diversity in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The project integrates statistical modeling and ecological network analysis using long-term monitoring data.

## Contents

- `Fish/analyze.ipynb`: [Interactive analysis notebook](/analyze.ipynb) containing data processing, modeling, and network visualizations.
- `data/`: Raw and processed data files (not included in repo if large).
- ## Data Summary

The final dataset, [combined_df_expanded_species.csv](/combined_df_expanded_species.csv), contains 434 observations across 21 years (2001â€“2021), integrating chemical water quality indicators and species-level fish counts. Each row represents a unique station-year combination. Functional group information is merged for further trait-based analysis.
